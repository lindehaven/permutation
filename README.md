# Permutation Strings

What is the length of the shortest string on an alphabet of n symbols that
contains all n! permutations of the alphabet as (contiguous) substrings?

Please see [Permutation Strings](http://www.notatt.com/permutations.pdf) by
Jeffrey A. Barnett for information about the algorithm.
